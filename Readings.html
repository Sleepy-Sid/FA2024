    <p> <b> 20. Creative Colour Branding </b>

An interesting trend I’m sure we’ve all been seeing in recent years is branding that includes a lot of bold colour palettes, mascots/cartoon elements, and modern typographical approaches to a brands identity. 

It seems like this trend is popular especially in packaging design; specifically with food brands. 

I feel like a lot of the cartoon incorporation into this kind of style tries to capture the younger millennial generation and gen z. 
        It takes advantage of our relationship with nostalgia, and takes advantage of our short attention spans.
        With colour being  a main focus. Personally I don’t really know how to feel about designs that feel overly bold and playful or “human” feeling because I feel although their grasp at relatability can sometimes come off as excessive.
        There’s also that association with brands trying to over compensate subpar products with bold colourful packaging. Like if I pick up a product that looks too colourful it kinda plays with how much I can actually trust a product,
        especially coming from an era that is so used to packaging that kinda speaks for itself. (Think mainstream v new age packaging) it sparks a question of reliability at least to me. 

I also feel like this trending is realllllly popular within e-commerce. So like products that rely on websites for a good portion of their sales. 
        In the case of a website however I feel it kinda pays off to be a little excessive with an identity’s colours and type because in the end of the day all that really matters is the consumer’s retention of that brand and its product. 

How do you guys feel about this trend?

<p> <b>Are Ugly Websites Better? </b>

I feel like this article really highlighted some good points in regards to the relationship between aesthetic and functionality. 
    As a designer we often forget to treat function as a principle of design within itself. 
    It goes back to the philosophies that inform design movements like minimalism and typographical trends like Swiss type. 
    It’s putting people first, assuming the consumer doesn’t know what it wants, and that it’s our jobs to put the metaphorical blinds on the horse.
